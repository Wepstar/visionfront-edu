VisionFront EDU: Youth-Led Climate & Health Animation Platform
Empowering youth to create culturally-relevant, AI-driven educational animation to combat climate and health challenges across West Africa.
1. Problem Statement
Climate change and health misinformation disproportionately affect rural youth and women in West Africa. Traditional awareness methods fail to engage or inspire. Meanwhile, high youth unemployment and digital exclusion prevent young people from becoming change agents in their own communities.
2. The Solution
VisionFront EDU is a mobile-first, AI-powered animation platform where youth co-create and distribute short, locally-relevant films on climate resilience, hygiene, nutrition, and maternal health—while gaining marketable digital skills.
3. Core Platform Features
- AI-assisted scriptwriting tools in local languages (Dagbani, Hausa, Twi)
- Mobile-friendly animation tools for basic Android devices
- Preloaded templates on health and climate topics
- Collaboration tools for youth groups and educators
- Offline sharing + distribution via radio, SMS, WhatsApp, TV
4. Sustainability & Revenue Model
- Subscription access for schools and NGOs
- Paid custom content creation for development agencies (UNICEF, WHO, USAID)
- Licensing of animated content for broadcasters and NGOs
- Paid training programs and technology licensing
5. Climate & Impact Integration
