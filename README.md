# VisionFront EDU

VisionFront EDU is an AI-powered, open-source animation platform that empowers African youth — especially girls — to create climate and health education content using mobile devices and local languages. It combines creative storytelling, AI scriptwriting, and simple mobile-friendly animation tools.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Over 740 million women and girls in developing economies lack access to essential health information and creative opportunities. VisionFront EDU fills this gap by enabling youth to become *creators*, not just consumers — educating their communities while learning vital digital skills.
